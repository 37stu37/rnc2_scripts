the purpose of this script is to create a theoretical temporal network
assuming the following processes workflow:

Rainfall -> Catchment -> River -> River -> Infrastructure (Flooding)

in more details:

Probability of rain
        |
Quantity of rain per hour
        |
Storage in each catchment (0 if no rain)
        |
Effective rainfall
        |
Local discharge at catchment
        |
Total discharge at catchment to river
        |
Update Storage in each catchment
        |
